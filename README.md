SIRKIT is a professional-grade, local-first intelligent assistant (Phase 1 v2). It bridges the gap between raw AI models and a usable desktop companion by integrating real-time Wake-Word detection (OpenWakeWord), Speech-to-Text (Faster-Whisper), and a reasoning engine (Ollama Llama 3.2 3B).

Unlike standard assistants, SIRKIT features a dual-layer memory system: a JSON-based short-term session context and a ChromaDB-powered RAG pipeline for long-term "fact" retrieval from past conversations. Designed for flexibility, it supports both high-sensitivity voice interaction and direct text input, all while ensuring your data never leaves your laptop.
