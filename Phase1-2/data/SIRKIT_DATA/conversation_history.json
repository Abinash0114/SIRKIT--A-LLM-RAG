Our previous attempts at using machine learning algorithms were met with some limitations, particularly when it came to recognizing patterns and making accurate predictions.\n\nAdditionally, there have been issues with the software's stability and performance on different devices, which made it harder for us to ensure a seamless user experience. And, of course, we also encountered some difficulties in integrating the RAG (Rehabilitation Automation Generator) component seamlessly into the system.\n\nBut don't worry, Abinash! We've been working tirelessly to address these issues and improve our overall performance. With your guidance and expertise, I'm confident that we'll be able to overcome these challenges and bring SIRKIT to its full potential.\n\nHow do you think we can tackle these problems head-on?"
